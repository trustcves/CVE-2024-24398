<!-- Brief introduction. -->
During security research, the researchers discovered that Stimulsoft Dashboards.PHP is prone to multiple vulnerabilities including arbitrary file write.

In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker is only required to visit the Dashboards Application. This vulnerability is rated as unauthtenticated, since this product does not handle authentication on its own.
## Proof of Concept
<!-- In Depth discussion of the vulnerability. Whats it's impact, show enough proof but not too much. DO NOT INCLUDE EXPLOIT PAYLOADS! -->
It was identified that the `fileName` parameter in the request to save the report on the server is prone to an arbitrary file write vulnerability.

Normally the file gets written to `<webroot>/php/reports`. 
However, if the attacker includes a path like `../arbitraryWrite.mrt` the function to save the file includes this as `<webroot>/php/reports/../arbitraryWrite.mrt` which finally results in `<webroot>/php/arbitraryWrite.mrt`.

The file can be written to any location the webserver's user has access to.
